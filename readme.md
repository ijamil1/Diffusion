Learning about diffusion models

Gaussian_Diffusion_forward_process_visualized: visualizing the forward process of Gaussian Diffusion for various target distributions in order to prove to myself that the marginal distribution of the variable at the final timestep of the forward process is normally distributed about the origin (assuming the target distribution is centered about the origin; based on the simple Gaussian forward process proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08929)
