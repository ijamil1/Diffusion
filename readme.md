Learning about diffusion models

Gaussian_Diffusion_forward_process_visualized: visualizing the forward process of Gaussian Diffusion for various target distributions in order to prove to myself that the marginal distribution of the variable at the final timestep of the forward process is normally distributed about the origin (assuming the target distribution is centered about the origin; based on the simple Gaussian forward process proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08929)

diffusion_models_from_scratch_Hugging_Face: followed a notebook tutorial I found from Hugging Face. All credit to Hugging Face for putting this together; it helped improve my understanding and make tangible the training process

Simple_DDPM: implemented a simple DDPM as motivated by https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08929.. trained on MNIST 16x16 images
